This project is a simple PHP CRUD application with user authentication and content management. The database contains two tables: one for user accounts (admins) and one for website content (content).

The SQL file database_setup.sql includes all commands to create these tables and insert initial homepage content. Please run this SQL file in your database to set up the project correctly.

The project allows users to register, login, view, add, update, and delete content and user information. The About page content is hardcoded in the PHP file.

All files, including PHP, CSS, and SQL, are included in this repository.
